`hey hey! you can call me edd simply (i am an edd fictionkin)`

i am a minor. and also turkish *(boowomp!)*

any pronouns are okay i dont care. i stand somewhere in the aroace spectrum. my dni is pretty much the basic criteria. nonetheless, i block freely

my destiny was being an **eddsworld** fan apparently + live laugh love liminal spaces/backrooms!

i like eddsworld goulden era the most. edd and matt come first in my likes. i also take interest in writing and drawing

> as for pony town, i sometimes dont mind if people cover me. i may wait until the person leaves; if not, i'll just move somewhere else as long as i'm not off tab or afk. or i may hide people if i get pissed off enough

> **i dont approach people usually! but i dont mind if people talk to me as long as i feel prepared. i am probably an ambivert or introvert. but i love socializing with people!**
