 # (🥤🥓) **HEY MAN!**

𓎟𓎟   ୭˚⋆✴︎˚｡⋆.     𓎟𓎟

you can call me edd simply —— *i am an edd fictionkin, if it wasn't obvious enough*

i am a minor. and also turkish *(boowomp!)*

any pronouns are okay i dont care. it/its also works. i stand somewhere in the aroace spectrum. my dni is pretty much the basic criteria. nonetheless, i block freely

my destiny was being an **eddsworld** fan apparently + live laugh love liminal spaces/backrooms!

i like eddsworld goulden era the most. edd and matt come first in my likes. i also take interest in writing and drawing

> *as for pony town, i sometimes dont mind if people cover me. i may wait until the person leaves; if not, i'll just move somewhere else as long as i'm not off tab or afk. or i may hide people if i get pissed off enough*

> *i dont mind if people c+h me . i like it*

> *w2i is welcome!*

> ***i dont approach people usually due to shyness. but i dont mind if people talk to me. i am probably an ambivert or introvert. but i love socializing with people!***
